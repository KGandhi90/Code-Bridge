## 🌍 Breaking Language Barriers in Programming

Imagine having a brilliant idea for an app or an innovation that could change the world—only to be held back, not by your skills, but by language.

Every day, countless aspiring developers struggle—not due to a lack of talent, but because coding is dominated by English syntax, documentation, and communities. Error messages are cryptic, tutorials feel inaccessible, and asking for help becomes an uphill battle.

But programming isn’t about English—it’s about logic, creativity, and problem-solving. So why should language be a barrier?

**CodeBridge** is here to change that. We’re building a platform that **translates, teaches, and empowers** programmers in their native language, making coding accessible to everyone, everywhere.
